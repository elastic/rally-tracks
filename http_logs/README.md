## HTTP logs track

This track is based on [Web server logs from the 1998 Football world cup](http://ita.ee.lbl.gov/html/contrib/WorldCup.html). 

Modifications: 

* Applied number to IP conversion as suggested in the original readme
* Removed illegal characters in "object_mappings.sort"
* Transformed the source data to a bulk-friendly JSON format (ignoring all entries that
  contained unrecognised / problematic characters and invalid IP addresses like "0";
  around 0.001% of the source data was lost due to this approach)

### Example Document

```json
{
  "@timestamp": 898459201,
  "clientip": "211.11.9.0",
  "request": "GET /english/index.html HTTP/1.0",
  "status": 304,
  "size": 0
}
```
