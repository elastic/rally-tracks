class WorkflowScheduler:
    """
    This scheduler is for use with the WorkflowSelectorParamSource source only.
    It allows the execution timing of a workflow to model a real user interaction. Each workflow consists of a series
    of actions - currently each action is a composite request and represents a user performing a UI function e.g.
    loading a dashboard. The actions are yielded by the WorkflowSelectorParamSource and executed sequentially.
    The timing between actions is controlled by an exponential distribution to result in execution times being Poisson
    distributed. This is controlled by the parameter 'think-time-interval'.
    When all actions in a workflow are exhausted, we consider its execution to be complete from a user perspective.
    The action index is reset to 0 and the workflow scheduled for execution using a different exponential rate
    determined by the parameter 'workflow-interval'. This also results in workflows executions being poisson
    distributed. This scheduler detects whether the execution should be delayed by a think-time-interval or
    workflow-interval by introspecting the parameter source for the current action index i.e. if current_index==0 use
    the workflow-interval else use think-time-interval.

    The random generation of intervals is seeded, to ensure deterministic values across different executions - allowing
    query loads to be repeated and compared.
