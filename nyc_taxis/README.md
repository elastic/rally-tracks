## NYC taxis track

This track contains the rides that have been performed in yellow taxis in New York in December 2015. It can be downloaded from http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml.

This has only been tested with the December 2015 dump, but this should work with any dump of the yellow taxis, and should be easy to adapt to the green taxis.

Once downloaded, you can generate the mappings with:

```
python3 _tools/parse.py mappings
```

And the json documents  can be generated with:

```  
python3 _tools/parse.py json file_name.csv > documents.json
```

Finally the json docs can be compressed with:

```
bzip2 -k documents.json
```
