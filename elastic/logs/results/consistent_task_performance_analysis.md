## üéØ KEY FINDING

**The contender (`date_nanos`) shows consistent performance overhead for ES|QL queries with date histogram and grouping operations, particularly those with limit=0.** 

The pattern is clear: ES|QL queries that perform:
- Time range filters + date histograms with grouping (`esql_time_range_and_date_histogram_two_groups_pre_filter_limit_0`)
- Basic count operations with 1-3 groups and limit=0 (`esql_basic_count_group_1/2/3_limit_0`)

These queries consistently show 3-18% throughput reduction and 4-27% latency increase when using `date_nanos` compared to `date`.
